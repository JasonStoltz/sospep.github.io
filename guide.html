These are things like lucid dreaming, artificial intelligence, utopian movements, and Esperanto. I'm mostly fine with boring the normals and living in the Vibrant True World of Beauty with its other full-on dork denizens. One of the things that holds my kinsmen together, though, is an unfortunate thing: they are all asses. They decimate the chances of their ideas' success by offending everyone they meet, making it look like being happy and having friends are suspicious, counterrevolutionary behaviors. I would propose that sacrificing some smaller truths in your day-to-day interactions is the only way for the greater truth to prevail</li>
