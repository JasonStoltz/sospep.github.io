			<p>We love a good guide! Don't have a clue how to do something with ___ ?, Open up a good guide and you can get started quickly with detailed step by step instructions, enough explanation to give you a bit of understanding but not drown you in theory, ... </p>

			<p> <a href="guide.html"> Guide *.*</a> is a compiled, curated listing of some of the best guides that we have come across on a number of different (mostly tech oriented) topics. We have categorized the guides into sections to help you to explore the areas that interest you most. </p>

			<p> 
				We avoided git for as long as we possibly could, but the time to put on our big boy britches and tame this beast has come. Starting with the absolute basics that you need to get started and working our way up and into the complexities of git, this is our journey into attempting to master the world of git by building a simple project and progressing from there.

				If you prefer to not use the automatic generator, push a branch named <code>gh-pages</code> to your repository to create a page manually. In addition to supporting regular HTML content, GitHub Pages support Jekyll, a simple, blog aware static site generator written by our own Tom Preston-Werner. Jekyll makes it easy to create site-wide headers and footers without having to copy them across every page. It also offers intelligent blog support and other advanced templating features.
